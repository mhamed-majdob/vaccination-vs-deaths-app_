# Do COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Correlate with Reduced Excess Deaths?
### A Data Science Project Using Real-World Global Data

---

## Overview

Vaccination has been one of the key public health strategies in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. But how effective were vaccines in reducing **excess deaths** — the number of deaths beyond what would be expected in a normal year?

In this project, I analyzed publicly available data to explore whether higher COVID-19 vaccination rates are associated with lower excess mortality in five countries. The goal was to uncover patterns, quantify relationships, and practice an end-to-end data science workflow using real-world data.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze time trends in vaccination rates and excess deaths
- Measure the strength of the relationship using linear regression
- Compare the results across different countries

## Data Sources
All data used in this project comes from **Our World in Data**, a public data repository:
- [COVID-19 Vaccination Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)
- [Excess Mortality Data](https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid)

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization
- **pandas**: Data cleaning and manipulation
- **matplotlib**: Visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Linear regression analysis

## Methodology Summary

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and merged two datasets on country and date.
   - Focused on five countries: India, United States, Brazil, Germany, Bangladesh.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Plotted vaccination rates and excess deaths over time for each country.
   - Observed trends and potential relationships.

3. **Regression Analysis**
   - Applied simple linear regression to assess how changes in vaccination rates related to excess deaths.
   - Calculated slope and R² score for each country.

4. **Result Export**
   - Saved regression results to a CSV file for easy comparison and reference.

## Results Overview

| Country       | Slope      | R² Score | Interpretation                              |
|---------------|------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| India         | -0.0271    | 0.23     | Vaccination helped; moderate effect         |
| United States | -0.0240    | 0.43     | Strong impact; vaccination explained 43% of change |
| Brazil        | -0.0139    | 0.17     | Modest effect; other factors involved       |
| Germany       | -0.0192    | 0.37     | Significant reduction in deaths; good fit   |
| Bangladesh    | -0.0113    | 0.08     | Weak effect; data may be noisy or limited   |

> Note: Negative slopes indicate that increased vaccination rates are associated with decreased excess deaths.

## Key Takeaways

- In all countries, higher vaccination rates were associated with **lower excess deaths**, though the strength of the relationship varied.
- The strongest relationship was observed in the **United States** and **Germany**, suggesting a clearer impact of vaccination.
- In countries like **Bangladesh**, the weaker relationship may be due to data quality, reporting issues, or other public health factors.
